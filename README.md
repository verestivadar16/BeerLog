BeerLog: Audio Analysis App
This Flutter application is designed to record audio, send it to a gRPC server, process the audio, and display the server's response back to the user. The server, implemented in Python using gRPC, processes the audio file to detect specific patterns (such as burps) and sends the analysis results back to the Flutter app.

Features
Record Audio: The app allows users to start and stop recording audio.
Send Recording: After stopping the recording, users can analyze the audio by sending it to the gRPC server for processing.
Server Status: The app displays whether the server is online or offline and provides an option to refresh the server status.
Display Server Response: Once the server processes the audio, the app displays the response (e.g., number of burps detected and their duration).
Components
Client (Flutter App):
Records audio using the device's microphone.
Communicates with the gRPC server to send recorded audio.
Displays server status and analysis results.
Server (Python gRPC Service):
Listens for audio data sent by the Flutter app.
Processes audio to detect patterns (e.g., burps) using a CNN-based model.
Returns analysis results to the Flutter app.
Technologies Used
Flutter: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
gRPC: Used for communication between the Flutter app (client) and Python server.
PyDub: Python library for audio processing (e.g., converting audio formats).
CNN Model: Utilized for audio pattern detection on the server-side.
Record Plugin: Used in Flutter for audio recording functionality.
Dart: Programming language for Flutter app development.
Python: Backend language for the gRPC server implementation.
Setup Instructions
Flutter App:
Ensure Flutter is installed on your system.
Clone this repository.
Open the project directory in a code editor.
Run flutter pub get to install dependencies.
Run the app using flutter run.
Python Server:
Install required Python packages (grpcio, pydub, protobuf).
Set up the gRPC server (serve function) to listen on a desired port.
Ensure the CNN model (process_audio) is correctly implemented for audio analysis.
Communication:
Make sure both the Flutter app and Python server are running on accessible network endpoints.
Adjust IP addresses and ports in the Flutter app and Python server code to match your setup.
Additional Notes
Security: This example uses an insecure gRPC channel (add_insecure_port), suitable for local or trusted network environments. For production use, implement secure communication (e.g., TLS).
Error Handling: Error handling is essential, especially during audio recording, transmission, and processing. Ensure comprehensive error handling mechanisms in both client and server components.
